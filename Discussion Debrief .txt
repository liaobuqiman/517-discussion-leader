1. What new insights came out of the discussion?
One thing I did think about when I read the paper is that Browser systems could take place in the future because the android app and other kinds of apps are lightweight, supported by ChromeOS, and convenient.


2. Was there disagreement? Why?
While the IBOS cons team believes IBOS provides stronger debugging in security domains, the IBOS pro team disagrees, claiming this will only happen in the future.
 
3. What was the consensus about the work?
IBOS is much more secure, but browsers like Google ChromeOS, which are already very popular, lack the hardware necessary to support it, and Google lacks hardware design expertise.
